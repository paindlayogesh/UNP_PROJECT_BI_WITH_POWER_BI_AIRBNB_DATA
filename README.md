# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_AIRBNB_DATA

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP) I developed a Powe BI dashboard to analyze AIRBNB DATA. This data was carefully prepared by removing unnecessary columns and errors and we have provided key insights into listings, pricing trends, availability, and host performance to optimize Airbnb operations. It highlights prime investment areas like Rosebank and Jamaica Hills, recommends focusing on private rooms and entire homes, and suggests dynamic pricing strategies for competitiveness. Smaller hosts can leverage unique guest experiences to compete with corporate hosts. The dashboard includes 20K+ listings, 814K+ reviews, an average price of $155, and 215 days of availability. These insights help investors, hosts, and strategists make data-driven decisions in the Airbnb market
